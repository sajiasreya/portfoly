                    <p> I Am a person who is not positive about every aspect of my life. There are many things I like to do, to
                        see, and to experience. I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I
                        like to talk, I like to listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the
                        moonlight at night; I like to feel the music flowing on my face, I like to smell the wind coming
                        from the ocean. I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind, I like to do thought
                        experiment when I cannot sleep in the middle of the night. I like flowers in spring, rain in
                        summer, leaves in autumn, and snow in winter. I like to sleep early, I like to get up late; I
                        like to be alone, I like to be surrounded by people. I like country’s peace, I like metropolis’
                        noise; I like the beautiful west lake in Hangzhou, I like the flat cornfield in Champaign. I
                        like delicious food and comfortable shoes; I like good books and romantic movies. I like the
                        land and the nature, I like people. And, I like to laugh.

                        I am Reya a graphic designer. I am here to provide you my best ideas and 4 years of experience in graphic design. I can help you create Professional Logos and any graphics and photo-related work.
